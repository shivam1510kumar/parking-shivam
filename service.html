      <p class="intro">
        We design, manufacture, and install a wide range of space-saving parking systems including:
        <strong>*Stack Parking Systems (2–3 levels)*</strong>
      </p>

      <div class="product-content">
        <p>
          Stack Parking System is an economical and simple parking solution for new buildings or existing societies where parking can be doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is designed to fit on the surface and double the car space by stacking the cars one above the other. The car must be driven off before the upper platform is lowered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stack parking system is designed to park cars of different heights as per the height availability at the customer’s location. It is perfect for residential, commercial projects, and parking garages where vertical stacking of cars is desired.

      <h2>Rotary Parking System</h2>
      <p>
        A rotary parking system, also called a carousel parking system, moves vehicles vertically in a circular loop — similar to a Ferris wheel. 
        It's an efficient solution for urban environments where space is limited, offering high-capacity storage with minimal land usage.

      <h2>Tower Parking Systems:</h2>
      <p>
        A Tower Parking System is a fully automated, high-density vertical parking solution that optimizes vehicle storage
using minimal ground space. Vehicles are lifted vertically by an elevator and then transferred horizontally into
storage racks on multiple levels. The entire process is automated, requiring no driver access inside the structure,
which enhances safety and efficiency. Cars are retrieved and returned at the ground level through a user-friendly
interface. This system is ideal for urban areas, commercial buildings, residential towers, and airports where land is
limited. With a scalable capacity ranging from 20 to over 100 vehicles, it offers a compact, space-saving solution.
Key benefits include minimal land usage, high security, low maintenance, and touchless operation. Designed for
modern infrastructure needs, Tower Parking supports smart city development and green building standards.
